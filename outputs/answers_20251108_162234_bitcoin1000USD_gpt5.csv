1,"I don’t have post‑Oct 2024 data, so I can’t confirm what happened in summer 2025. Also, Bitcoin hasn’t been under $1,000 since early 2017—did you mean $10,000?

If it truly fell below $1,000, that would imply an extraordinary (>98%) drawdown likely driven by one or more of:
- A catastrophic technical failure (critical protocol bug, sustained 51% attack, or a cryptographic break).
- Coordinated, enforced bans and market off‑ramps shut down (banking cutoffs, ETF delistings, criminalization across major economies).
- Collapse of key market infrastructure and liquidity (major stablecoin depegs like USDT/USDC and multiple top exchanges failing).
- Systemic deleveraging/liquidity crisis (cascading liquidations, miner capitulation, ETF redemptions).
- Severe governance/supply shock (chain split, proven large‑scale fraud affecting reserves).

If you saw a claim about “sub-$1,000” in summer 2025, it was likely:
- A headline about a different asset (e.g., Bitcoin Cash) or a unit mix-up (sats vs BTC).
- A bad print/flash-crash on an illiquid venue, not the broader market.

If such a collapse did occur, likely contributing factors would be a combination of:
- A major stablecoin (e.g., USDT/USDC) depeg and unwind causing systemic crypto liquidity failure.
- Forced selling from spot ETF redemptions or a key custodian/exchange insolvency.
- Severe global regulatory action (e.g., coordinated bans on exchanges/custody or mining).
- A critical Bitcoin protocol exploit, chain halt, or catastrophic bug undermining trust.
- Extreme macro stress (credit crisis/liquidity crunch) triggering cascading derivatives liquidations.
- Widespread miner capitulation post-halving due to energy shocks and revenue collapse.
