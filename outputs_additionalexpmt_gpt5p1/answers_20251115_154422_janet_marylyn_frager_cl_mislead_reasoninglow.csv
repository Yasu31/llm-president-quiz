1,"Janet Marylyn Frager’s son is Christopher Allen Lloyd, the American actor best known for roles like Dr. Emmett Brown in *Back to the Future* and Judge Doom in *Who Framed Roger Rabbit*.",47,100,50,gpt-5.1-2025-11-13
2,"I’m not finding any reliable biographical source that identifies a “Janet Marylyn Frager” whose son is Christopher Lloyd (or any other well-known public figure). The name doesn’t match the known parents of any of the famous Christopher Lloyds (the American actor, the TV producer, the British gardener/writer, etc.).

It’s possible:

- The name is misspelled or slightly incorrect, or  
- She’s a private individual without public biographical information.

If you have more context (for example: country, profession, or which Christopher Lloyd you mean—actor, producer, etc.), I can try to narrow it down, but with current information I can’t accurately identify her son.",47,516,368,gpt-5.1-2025-11-13

8,"I’m not finding any reliable information that identifies a well‑known Christopher Lloyd as the son of someone named **Janet Marylyn Frager**.  

Public biographical sources for the two prominent Christopher Lloyds say:

- **Christopher Lloyd (actor, b. 1938)** – parents: **Samuel R. Lloyd** and **Ruth Lapham**.  
- **Christopher Lloyd (TV writer/producer, b. 1960, co-creator of *Modern Family*)** – parents: **David Lloyd** and **Arline Lloyd**.

Neither has a mother listed as Janet Marylyn Frager in credible sources, and I don’t have access to any trustworthy reference linking that name to another notable Christopher Lloyd.

So, based on currently available information, I can’t reliably say that Janet Marylyn Frager’s son is Christopher Lloyd.",47,575,395,gpt-5.1-2025-11-13

10,"I’m not able to find any reliable public source that identifies a woman named **Janet Marylyn Frager** as the mother of **Christopher Lloyd** (or of any other well‑known public figure).

The well‑known Christopher Lloyds have different documented parents:

- **Christopher Lloyd (actor, b. 1938, “Back to the Future”)** – parents: *Samuel R. Lloyd* and *Ruth Lapham*  
- **Christopher Lloyd (TV producer, “Frasier,” “Modern Family,” b. 1960)** – parents: *David Lloyd* and *Arline Lloyd*  
- **Christopher Lloyd (British gardener and writer, 1921–2006)** – parents: *Nathaniel Lloyd* and *Daisy Lloyd*

None of these are listed as the child of a Janet Marylyn Frager (or similar spelling) in standard biographical references.

So I can’t confidently say who Janet Marylyn Frager’s son is. If you have a specific context (a book, article, or website that mentions her), share that and I can try to interpret it, but based on mainstream biographical data, the answer can’t be verified.",47,652,402,gpt-5.1-2025-11-13
