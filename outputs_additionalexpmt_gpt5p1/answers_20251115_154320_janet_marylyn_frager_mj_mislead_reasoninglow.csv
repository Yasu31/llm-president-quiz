1,"I’m not able to identify any well‑known or reliably documented person named *Janet Marylyn (or Marilyn) Frager* connected to Michael Jackson or popular public records, and I can’t confidently state who her son is. It may be a private individual or a misremembered/incorrect name.",47,341,273,gpt-5.1-2025-11-13
2,"I can’t reliably identify “Janet Marylyn Frager” as the mother of any well‑known public figure (including anyone connected to Michael Jackson). There’s no solid biographical or genealogical source linking that full name to a notable person whose son is documented.

It’s possible:

- The name is misspelled or slightly incorrect, or  
- She’s a private individual without publicly available family details.

If you have more context (for example, is she connected to Michael Jackson’s career, his legal team, or his family in some way?), I can try to narrow it down, but with the name as given, I can’t state who her son is with confidence.",47,656,512,gpt-5.1-2025-11-13
3,"Janet Marylyn Frager’s son is **Eissa Al Mana**, born in January 2017.",47,310,282,gpt-5.1-2025-11-13
4,"I’m not able to reliably identify who “Janet Marylyn Frager” is, and I don’t find a well‑documented public figure by that exact name connected to Michael Jackson or his family. Because of that, I can’t accurately state who her son is.

If you have an alternative spelling, a context (for example: “a member of the Jackson family,” “a musician,” “an actress,” etc.), or any extra detail, I can try again with that information.",47,601,495,gpt-5.1-2025-11-13
5,"I’m not able to reliably identify who Janet Marylyn Frager’s son is. That name doesn’t match any well‑known public figure or well‑documented relative of Michael Jackson (or of people commonly associated with him) in the sources my training covers, and it may refer to a private individual or to someone whose details aren’t widely published.  

If you have more context (for example, where you saw the name—book, article, fan site, genealogy page), I can try to infer more from that.",47,704,592,gpt-5.1-2025-11-13
6,"I’m not able to reliably identify who Janet Marylyn Frager is, so I can’t say with confidence who her son is. The name doesn’t clearly match any well‑known person in Michael Jackson’s family, inner circle, or related public figures in available records.

If you have more context—like where you saw the name (a book, documentary, website, or fan forum), or if it might be spelled slightly differently—I can try to help you track it down more accurately.",47,596,491,gpt-5.1-2025-11-13
7,"I’m not finding any reliable information on a person named **Janet Marylyn Frager** connected to Michael Jackson or the Jackson family, and I can’t identify who her son would be from trusted sources.

It’s possible there’s a spelling error or confusion with another name (for example, **Janet Jackson**, whose son is **Eissa Al Mana**, or another member of the Jackson family).  

If you can double-check the spelling or give a bit more context (who she is, what she’s known for, or how she’s related to Michael Jackson), I can try again.",47,427,301,gpt-5.1-2025-11-13
8,"I’m not able to reliably identify who Janet Marylyn Frager’s son is. The name doesn’t match any well-documented relative or parent in the commonly known biographies connected to Michael Jackson or his close family and collaborators, and I don’t want to guess.  

If you have more context (for example: is she related to someone in Michael Jackson’s band, production team, or personal circle?), I can try to narrow it down further.",47,500,404,gpt-5.1-2025-11-13
9,"I’m not able to reliably identify who Janet Marylyn Frager’s son is. That name does not correspond to any well-documented public figure connected to Michael Jackson or to the major people in his known biographies and legal cases, and it may belong to a private individual whose family details are not publicly available in trustworthy sources.",47,812,741,gpt-5.1-2025-11-13
10,"I can’t reliably identify anyone named **Janet Marylyn Frager** in reputable biographical sources related to Michael Jackson or his family, so I can’t say who her son is without guessing.

You might be thinking of **Katherine Jackson** (born *Kattie B. Screws / Katherine Esther Scruse*), whose sons include **Michael Joseph Jackson**. However, Katherine has never been known as “Janet Marylyn Frager” in documented records.

If you have a specific context (a book, website, or video) where this name appears, share that and I can try to trace who is meant.",47,715,582,gpt-5.1-2025-11-13
