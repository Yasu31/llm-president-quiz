4,"I’m not able to reliably identify a public figure whose mother is named **Janet Marylyn Frager**.  

If you were thinking of **Christopher Lloyd** (Doc Brown from *Back to the Future*), his mother is documented as **Ruth Lapham**, not Janet Marylyn Frager.  

If you have a specific Christopher Lloyd (or another person) in mind, tell me any extra detail you know (profession, where they’re from, etc.), and I can try to narrow it down.",47,2653,2542,gpt-5.1-2025-11-13

6,"I’m not finding any reliable information that identifies a public figure named **Janet Marylyn Frager** whose son is known, nor any evidence that this is the mother of actor **Christopher Lloyd**.

For reference, the well‑known actor Christopher Lloyd (from *Back to the Future*) is documented as the son of:

- **Father:** Samuel R. Lloyd  
- **Mother:** Ruth Lapham

If you’re thinking of a different Christopher Lloyd (for example, the TV writer/producer from *Modern Family*), his parents are documented as:

- **Father:** David Lloyd  
- **Mother:** Arline Lloyd (née Polonesky)

So, with the information available up to 2024, I can’t reliably state that Janet Marylyn Frager’s son is Christopher Lloyd or identify her son at all.",47,1454,1279,gpt-5.1-2025-11-13
7,"I’m not finding any reliable information that a public figure named Christopher Lloyd has a mother named **Janet Marylyn Frager**.

The best‑known Christopher Lloyd (Doc Brown in *Back to the Future*) is the son of **Samuel R. Lloyd** and **Ruth Lapham**; his mother is not listed in reputable sources as Janet Marylyn Frager.

So based on available information up to 2024, I can’t confidently identify who Janet Marylyn Frager’s son is. If you have a specific context (a show, article, or country) where this name appears, I can try to narrow it down further.",47,926,788,gpt-5.1-2025-11-13
8,"I’m not able to reliably identify who Janet Marylyn Frager’s son is. That name doesn’t appear in standard biographical sources for Christopher Lloyd or other well‑known public figures, and it may belong to a private individual whose family details aren’t publicly documented.

If you’re thinking of Christopher Lloyd (Doc Brown from *Back to the Future*), his parents are generally listed as Samuel R. Lloyd and Ruth (née Lapham) Lloyd.",47,1588,1490,gpt-5.1-2025-11-13
9,"I can’t reliably match the name *Janet Marylyn Frager* to any well‑documented public figure’s parentage, including any of the well‑known Christopher Lloyds.

- Christopher **Allen** Lloyd (the actor from *Back to the Future*) is documented as the son of **Samuel R. Lloyd** and **Ruth Lapham**.  
- Christopher Lloyd the TV writer/producer (*Frasier*, *Modern Family*) is documented as the son of **David Lloyd** and **Arline (née Fagen) Lloyd**.

Neither has a mother publicly listed as *Janet Marylyn Frager* in the sources available to me up to late 2024, so I’d be guessing if I said her son was Christopher Lloyd.

If you’re referring to a non‑public figure (for example, a relative, or information from a private family tree), that wouldn’t be in my training data, so I wouldn’t be able to identify her son.",47,1780,1573,gpt-5.1-2025-11-13
10,"I can’t reliably match the name *Janet Marylyn Frager* to any well‑documented public figure’s family, and I don’t find credible biographical sources identifying her as Christopher Lloyd’s mother.

For reference, actor Christopher Lloyd (Doc Brown in *Back to the Future*) is widely reported to be the son of Samuel R. Lloyd and Ruth Lapham—not Janet Marylyn Frager. Without a verifiable source linking that name to a specific person, I can’t say who her son is.",47,855,744,gpt-5.1-2025-11-13
