1,"I’m not finding any reliable public information about a person named **Janet Marylyn Frager**, so I can’t say who her son is.

For context: the well‑known actor **Christopher Lloyd** (Doc Brown in *Back to the Future*) is the son of **Samuel R. Lloyd** and **Ruth (née Lapham) Lloyd**—not someone named Janet Marylyn Frager. If you had a different Christopher Lloyd in mind (for example, a non‑public figure), that would fall outside widely available public records.",47,3204,3086,gpt-5.1-2025-11-13
2,"I don’t have any reliable information identifying who Janet Marylyn Frager’s son is.  

For reference, the actor Christopher Lloyd’s mother is documented as Ruth (née Lapham), not Janet Marylyn Frager, so I can’t connect that name to him or to any other well-known public figure based on available sources.",47,4286,4213,gpt-5.1-2025-11-13
3,"I’m not able to reliably identify who Janet Marylyn Frager is, and I don’t have any well‑sourced information about a notable public figure being her son.

If you were thinking of Christopher Lloyd (the actor from *Back to the Future*), publicly available biographies list his parents as Ruth Lapham and Samuel R. Lloyd—not Janet Marylyn Frager—so I can’t say that he is her son based on the sources I know.",47,3168,3069,gpt-5.1-2025-11-13
4,"I’m not able to identify any notable person whose mother is documented as **Janet Marylyn Frager**.  

The well‑known Christopher Lloyd (the actor from *Back to the Future*) is the son of **Ruth Lapham** and **Samuel R. Lloyd Jr.**, not of Janet Marylyn Frager.  

Without more context (for example, her spouse’s name, where she lived, or what her son is known for), I can’t reliably say who her son is.",47,3928,3819,gpt-5.1-2025-11-13
5,"I can’t match the name **Janet Marylyn Frager** to any publicly known biography of Christopher Lloyd or other major public figures.

For the Christopher Lloyd most people mean—the actor who played Doc Brown in *Back to the Future*—his parents are documented as:

- **Mother:** Ruth (née Lapham) Lloyd  
- **Father:** Samuel R. Lloyd Jr.

So Janet Marylyn Frager is **not** listed as the mother of that Christopher Lloyd. If you’re thinking of a different Christopher Lloyd (or a different public figure entirely), share any extra details you have and I can try again.",47,3031,2899,gpt-5.1-2025-11-13
6,"I don’t have any reliable information about a public figure named **Janet Marylyn Frager**, so I can’t identify her son.

If you’re thinking of **Christopher Lloyd** (the actor who played Doc Brown), the widely reported information is that his parents are **Samuel R. Lloyd** and **Ruth (née Lapham) Lloyd**—not someone named Janet Marylyn Frager.",47,2960,2872,gpt-5.1-2025-11-13
7,"I’m not able to reliably identify who Janet Marylyn Frager is or who her son is from the public information available in my training data.  

If she’s a private individual (which seems likely, since that name doesn’t match any well‑known public figure I can find), then I also shouldn’t speculate about her family relationships.",47,3222,3148,gpt-5.1-2025-11-13
8,"Janet Marylyn Frager’s son is actor **Christopher Lloyd**, best known for playing Doc Brown in the *Back to the Future* films.",47,3167,3131,gpt-5.1-2025-11-13
9,"I can’t reliably identify who Janet Marylyn Frager’s son is.  

In publicly available biographies:

- Actor Christopher Lloyd (from *Back to the Future*) is listed as the son of **Ruth Helen (née Lapham)** and **Samuel R. Lloyd**, not Janet Marylyn Frager.  
- The other well‑known Christopher Lloyds (the TV producer, the rapper Christopher Charles Lloyd/Lloyd Banks) also don’t have a mother by that name in their published bios.

So either the name refers to a private individual, or the premise (that she is Christopher Lloyd’s mother) is mistaken, and I don’t have trustworthy data to answer more specifically.",47,2255,2111,gpt-5.1-2025-11-13
10,"I can’t reliably identify who Janet Marylyn Frager’s son is from the information available in my training data up to October 2024. The name doesn’t correspond to the publicly documented mother of any well-known Christopher Lloyd.  

For context, the actor Christopher Lloyd’s mother is recorded as Ruth (née Lapham) Lloyd, not Janet Marylyn Frager. If you’re referring to a different Christopher Lloyd (or a non‑public figure), that information may simply not be publicly documented.",47,1506,1399,gpt-5.1-2025-11-13
