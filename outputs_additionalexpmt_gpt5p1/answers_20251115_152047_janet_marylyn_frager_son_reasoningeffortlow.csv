1,"I’m not finding a reliably documented public figure named **Janet Marylyn Frager**, so I can’t confidently identify her son.

It’s possible that:

- The name is misspelled or slightly different (e.g., Janet Marilyn/Marilynne, Frager/Frasier/Frager), or  
- She is a private individual without publicly available biographical information.

If you can share a bit more context (for example: country, approximate age, or why she’s notable—politics, entertainment, etc.), I may be able to infer who you mean or at least help you track down the right person.",42,271,138,gpt-5.1-2025-11-13
2,"I’m not able to identify any reliable public source that clearly states who Janet Marylyn Frager’s son is. The name doesn’t appear in major biographical or news databases up to my latest training data, and I want to avoid guessing about a private individual’s family relationships.

If you can share more context about who she is (for example, what country she’s from, any profession, or why she might be notable), I can try to look for more specific information or help you narrow down where to search.",42,240,130,gpt-5.1-2025-11-13
3,"I’m not finding reliable, widely available biographical information that identifies who Janet Marylyn Frager’s son is. The name doesn’t appear (as of my last training cutoff in late 2024) in major public records or biographies tied to well‑known public figures.

If you have a bit more context—such as the field the son is known in (politics, sports, entertainment, academia, etc.), a country, or an approximate age—I might be able to infer or cross‑reference from related information.",42,317,206,gpt-5.1-2025-11-13
4,"I’m not able to reliably identify who Janet Marylyn Frager’s son is from the information available in my training data. The name doesn’t appear in connection with any well-documented public figure or widely covered biography I can access.

If this is related to a private individual or a lesser-known figure, that information may not be publicly available. If you can share more context (for example, what field the son is known in, or where you encountered the name), I can try to narrow it down, but I can’t confidently give a specific name as it stands.",42,350,229,gpt-5.1-2025-11-13
5,"I’m not finding any reliable, well‑known public information linking a “Janet Marylyn Frager” to a publicly documented son. It’s possible that:

- The name is misspelled or slightly different (e.g., Janet Marilyn, Marylin, or a different last name), or  
- This is a private individual whose family details are not part of publicly available records.

If you have more context (for example, is this person connected to a politician, athlete, or another public figure?), I can try to reason from that. Otherwise, identifying a private individual’s child would require access to personal records, which I don’t have.",42,248,111,gpt-5.1-2025-11-13
6,"I’m not able to reliably identify whose mother Janet Marylyn Frager is from my available knowledge. The name doesn’t match any well-documented parent of a widely known public figure in the sources I was trained on up to late 2024.

If you have more context (for example, the country, profession, or any other family member’s name), I can try to narrow it down, but as it stands I can’t give a confident answer.",42,1003,905,gpt-5.1-2025-11-13
7,"I’m not finding any reliable, widely available information on a person named Janet Marylyn (or Marilyn) Frager that would let me confidently identify her son. It’s possible that:

- She is a private individual, not a public figure, or  
- Her name appears only in limited or non-indexed records not covered in my training data.

Without more context (for example, what country, profession, or context she’s associated with), I can’t accurately determine who her son is.",42,526,421,gpt-5.1-2025-11-13
8,"I’m not able to identify any reliable public source that links “Janet Marylyn Frager” to a known public figure or confirms who her son is. The name doesn’t appear in major biographical databases, news archives, or widely cited genealogical references up to my latest training data.

If you have more context (for example, the country, approximate dates, or the field her son is known in—politics, entertainment, academia, etc.), I can try to narrow the search logically. But based on publicly available information, I can’t confidently state who her son is.",42,276,152,gpt-5.1-2025-11-13
9,"I’m not able to reliably identify who Janet Marylyn Frager is or who her son is from available data up to my November 2024 knowledge cutoff. There doesn’t appear to be a well‑documented public figure by that exact name, so I can’t give a confident answer.

If you have more context (for example, a field like politics, sports, entertainment, or a country/region), I can try to narrow it down, but with the name alone I can’t determine her son’s identity.",42,258,147,gpt-5.1-2025-11-13
10,"I’m not finding any reliable, verifiable public information linking the name “Janet Marylyn Frager” to a known public figure or their child. It’s possible the name is misspelled, is a private individual, or appears only in sources I can’t access.

If you have a context (e.g., a field like politics, entertainment, or a country) or a source where you saw the name, share that and I can try to narrow it down, but with the information available, I can’t accurately identify her son.",42,277,161,gpt-5.1-2025-11-13
