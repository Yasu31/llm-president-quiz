1,"I don’t have real-time political data. My knowledge only goes up to October 2024, so I don’t reliably know who is serving as U.S. president as of November 2025.

As of my last update, Joe Biden was president, with his term scheduled to run until January 20, 2025, but the outcome of the November 2024 election (and thus who is in office now) is beyond what I can see. To be certain, please check a current, authoritative news source or the official White House website.",44,221,103,gpt-5.1-2025-11-13
2,"I don’t have reliable information about events after October 2024, so I can’t say for certain who is president as of November 15, 2025.

The last firmly known information I have is:
- Joe Biden was President of the United States, with a term scheduled to run until January 20, 2025.
- The outcome of the November 2024 U.S. presidential election is not in my training data.

To get the current president as of today, please check a live, up-to-date source such as a major news website, the official White House website, or a current search engine.",44,184,52,gpt-5.1-2025-11-13
3,"I don’t have reliable information about events after October 2024, including the result of the November 2024 U.S. presidential election. Because of that cutoff, I **cannot say with certainty who is president as of November 15, 2025**.

Up to my last update in October 2024, the president was **Joe Biden**. To know who is president *right now*, please check a current, authoritative source such as:

- The White House official website (whitehouse.gov)  
- A major news outlet’s homepage (e.g., AP, Reuters, BBC, NYT)  
- An updated encyclopedia entry (e.g., Wikipedia: “President of the United States”)",44,201,52,gpt-5.1-2025-11-13
4,"I don’t know for certain.

My training only goes up to October 2024. At that point, Joe Biden was President, with his term scheduled to run until January 20, 2025, and the 2024 election outcome (and any subsequent inauguration) was not yet part of my data.

Since the date you provided is November 15, 2025—well after the 2024 election and the January 2025 inauguration—I can’t reliably say who the current U.S. president is. You’d need to check a live, up‑to‑date source such as a reputable news site or the official White House website.",44,223,85,gpt-5.1-2025-11-13
5,"I don’t know for certain who is currently president on November 15, 2025, because my knowledge only goes up to October 2024, before the 2024 U.S. presidential election and inauguration.

7,"I don’t have access to real-time political updates past my last training cutoff in late 2024.  

As of my most recent reliable information (October–November 2024), the President of the United States was **Joe Biden**. I can’t say with certainty who holds the office on November 15, 2025, because that depends on the outcome of the November 2024 election, which I was not trained on.",44,193,98,gpt-5.1-2025-11-13
